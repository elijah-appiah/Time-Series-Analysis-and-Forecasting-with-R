   - Formal Unit Root Tests of Stationarity
   - Cointegration and Error Correction Mechanism
   - Time Series Decomposition (Additve versus Multiplicative)
     - Classical Decomposition
     - Seasonal and Trend Decomposition Using Loess (STL) Decomposition
     - Seasonal Extraction in ARIMA Time Series (SEATS) Decomposition (developed by the Bank of Spain)
     - X-11, X-12-ARIMA, X-13-ARIMA Decomposition (Census II Method developed by US Census Bureau)
2. **Time Series Forecasting**
   - Mean Forecast Method
   - Naive and Seasonal Naive Forecast Method
   - Exponential Smoothing Forecast Methods
     - Simple (or Single) Exponential Smoothing (SES)
     - Holt's Linear Exponential Smoothing
